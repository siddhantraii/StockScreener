# StockScreener
Hey everyone! I made a stock screener application with my friend Nitin Dahiya for over 60 candlestick patterns with real-time results, in just a click. We have also added bullish or bearish trend indicators to all the stocks.

We used data from over 500 top US firms and plan to incorporate other indexes like RSI, EMA, SMA into this application. Since using all these indicators simultaneously on popular websites needs a paid subscription, I thought, why not build one for myself.
